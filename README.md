idea for skill based game app

* website shows 5 slots
* you and your friends sign up using IGN and e-mail
* once 5 slots filled, skill based game starts
* players are tracked via riot api for one week
* player who does the best (measure via LP or something???) wins a prize
* monetize with ads
* limit number of concurrent games
